<h3 align="center">How to begin?</h3>

1. Don't Wanna Wrestle with Code Dragons?
We got you, champ. Fear not the dreaded setup process! Just mosey on over to your project folder and mutter this magic incantation into your terminal:
   ```bash
   bash setup.sh
   ```
2. Poof! Your bot is prepped and primed. Now, high-tail it over to `src/main.js` and play around with the code like it's Play-Doh. Don't worry, there's a default version in there if you're feeling a bit peckish.
3. Time to Unleash the Beast! With your masterpiece crafted, unleash it upon the world with this battle cry:
   ```bash
   bash start.sh
   ```
4. There you have it! Your bot is ready to mingle with the Discord masses. Now go forth and conquer,  or at least make a bot that spams cat gifs (we won't judge).
<h3 align="center">Uh Oh, Spaghetti Code Alert!</h3>
Did things go south faster than a toddler on a sugar rush? Don't fret, fellow coder! The official Forgescript Discord server is your haven. Just waltz in, find the support channel, and unleash your cries for help. There's a friendly bunch there who will do their best to untangle your codey mess (unless it involves spaghetti, then you're on your own).
